# Simple Linear Regression Model

Created: 29, October 2019

This repo contains projects that I completed to help teach myself Python. I
created these projects as series of extra credit projects for an introductory
programming course taught by Professor Warren Sheaffer.

This program is designed to create a simple linear regression model for a
series of (x,y) coordinates A regression line is a linear function that best
fits a data data set when plotted on a cartesian graph. This repo contains:

* A simple linear regression caclulator with a graphical visualizer.
* An unfinished/amateurish basic statistics library.

Program requires John Zelle's graphics library which is also included in this
repo in the `graphics.py` file.
