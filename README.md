# Simple Linear Regression Model

Created 2019

This repo contains projects that I completed to help teach myself Python. I
created these projects as series of extra credit projects for an introductory
programming course taught by Professor Warren Sheaffer.

There are two main projects and an incomplete library contained here including:

* A simple linear regression caclulator with a graphical visualizer.
* An unfinished/amateurish basic statistics library.

All programs require John Zelle's graphics library.
