# Python Projects

This repo contains projects that I completed to help teach myself Python. I created these projects as series of extra credit projects for an introductory programming course taught by Professor Warren Sheaffer.

There are two main projects and an incomplete library contained here including:

* A simple linear regression caclulator with a graphical visualizer.
* A program that demonstrates how to estimate Pi using the Monte Carlo method with a graphical animation.
* An unfinished/amateurish basic statistics library.

All programs require John Zelle's graphics library.
